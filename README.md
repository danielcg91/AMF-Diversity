This repository contains the code used to perform the upstream and downstream statistical analyses in Chavez-Gonzalez, et al. 2023 which was modified from the pipeline in Flores-Nu√±es et al., 2023

0.-AMFData.bash : Pipeline that processes 16SrRNAV4 and ITS2 amplicon sequencing paired reads to generate OTUs, OTU table, and Taxonomic classification. see a citation on the manuscript. Also, contains the functions to make the reverse complement for 16S sequences.

1-Parse.output-AMF.R: ./data : includes 16S and ITS filtered OTUs, OTU table, taxonomic classification, and metadata

2.-getOTUdata-ITS2-16S.R: R script that generates filtered OTU, taxa and metadata tables for future analyses. 

3.-AMFdata-root.colonization.R: R script and test analyses with the data generated in Chavez-Gonzalez, et al. 2023 

4.-Barplots-VennDiagramsT12-AMF-16Spore.R and Barplots-VennDiagramsT12-ITS-16S.R: R script that generates all barplots of taxonomic classification, VennDiagrams and all packages used.
